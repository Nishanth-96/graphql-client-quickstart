# graphql-client-quickstart

Sample Apollo graphql client

## Introduction

Graphql is a query language through which data fetching is made very simple for the client. In comparison with the traditional REST API calls, graphql resolves the round trip problem for the client. What's more, you can request only the fields you need. In short, it solves the underfetching/overfetching problems.

The project demonstrates the power of graphql by using Covid data.
